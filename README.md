Context-Aware Lightweight IoT Security (CALIS): An adaptive scheme for IoT that uses machine learning to analyze device context (battery, CPU, data size, sensitivity) and dynamically select optimal lightweight encryption (ASCON, ChaCha20, AES) and key rotation frequency, balancing security and resource use for efficient IoT protection.
